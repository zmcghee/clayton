I'm building a new personal website for myself. Along the way, I'm documenting the process by making the code public.

You can see by looking at the .gitignore which files I've omitted for either cleanliness or safety reasons. In particular, there is a clayton/conf/secret.py file that is omitted because it contains sensitive information, like the database config.
